# Caesar Cipher

This Java program implements the Caesar Cipher, a simple substitution cipher technique. The Caesar Cipher shifts each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet. 

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the `CaesarCipher.java` file.

2. Compile the `CaesarCipher.java` file using any Java compiler:

    ```sh
    javac CaesarCipher.java
    ```

3. Run the compiled program:

    ```sh
    java CaesarCipher
    ```

4. Follow the prompts to enter the text you want to encrypt or decrypt, specify the operation (encrypt or decrypt), provide the key (number of shifts), and choose the direction of the shift (left or right).

## Example

```sh
Enter the text to encrypt or decrypt:
hello
Enter 'e' to encrypt or 'd' to decrypt:
e
Enter the key (number of shifts):
3
Enter 'l' for left shift or 'r' for right shift:
r
Encrypted text: khoor
